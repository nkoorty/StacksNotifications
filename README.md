# StacksNotifications
StacksNotifications is a tool designed to provide developers with immediate notifications when specific events occur on their smart contracts. 

## Key Features
StacksNotifications allows developers to subscribe to notifications for predefined events such as transactions, state changes, or custom triggers on their smart contracts. By integrating with the Stacks ecosystem, StacksNotifications leverages its secure and scalable execution of smart contracts, making it an essential tool for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) and services on Stacks.

Notifications are personalized based on individual contract interactions, ensuring developers only receive relevant updates. This enhances operational efficiency and relevance. StacksNotifications will also support dynamic email notifications, allowing developers to receive alerts directly in their inboxes, ensuring they stay informed even when not actively monitoring the platform.

The user-friendly developer dashboard allows for easy management of notification preferences, viewing historical events, and configuring settings related to contracts and notifications.

## How It's Made
StacksNotifications utilizes the Stacks blockchain for smart contract deployment and execution, leveraging its architecture and performance benefits for real-time event monitoring. Clarity ensures secure and predictable execution of these contracts.

The platform includes efficient event fetching and management tools that track specific smart contract events and trigger notifications in real-time. Dynamic email integration ensures timely notifications via a flexible email service provider that adapts delivery based on blockchain-triggered events.

The frontend, built with Next.js, provides an intuitive interface for developers to manage contract notifications and access historical event data. Backend services handle event detection, notification processing, and API interactions with the Stacks blockchain and email services. Additionally, node-cron supports scheduled tasks, enhancing operational automation.

## Getting Started
To get started with StacksNotifications on Stacks, clone the repository, install dependencies, set up environment variables, deploy your Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, and run the application. Access the dashboard via your browser to manage your notifications.
